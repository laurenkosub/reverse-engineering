Access Binary Requirements
- there must be an etc directory in the home directory
- the etc directory should contain a file called passwd
- the passwd file should contain lines with the format <username>:<password>\r\n

Backdoor Explanation
In order to access the back door, you need to cause a SIGINT three times. You can do this with Ctrl-C. 
Then you need to enter a valid username that is in the etc/passwd file in the username filed.
In the password field, enter the string "%s\t\t%s". \t is the tab character,
and you need to hit the escape button followed by the tab button in order to write '\t'.

Below is the output:

./access
Username: ^C^C^CTim
Ctrl+C does not work here!
